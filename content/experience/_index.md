##### Data Scince Intern (Jan/2022 - Set/2022)
Developed a price-elasticity modeling approach through Panel Data Regression and Supervised Machine Learning for products of a market-leading company in the civil construction sector. The developed modeling technique was applied to models in production to incorporate the behavior of market price dynamics and adjust item recommendations.

### FAPESP - Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo
##### Researcher in Applied Machine Learning
As a [FAPESP](https://fapesp.br/) researcher, I developed under the guidance of [Prof. Renato Fernandes Cantão]() a scientific initiation project focused on Machine Learning applications in the context of photovoltaic solar energy. During this project, machine learning-based modeling strategies were developed and implemented to predict solar radiation in locations in the State of São Paulo, Brazil.
