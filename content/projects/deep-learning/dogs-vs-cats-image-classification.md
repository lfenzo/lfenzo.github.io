**Background**

This dataset was originally released as part of a Kaggle competition hosted by Microsoft Research in 2013. It became a classic benchmark for beginner and intermediate deep learning practitioners due to its simplicity and effectiveness in demonstrating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in image classification tasks.

**Highlights**
- Implemented using PyTorch and Torchvision
- Transfer Learning with pre-trained ResNet-50 weights
- Used Cross Entropy Loss and evaluated with F1 Score
- Achieved 98% weighted F1 Score in test set

**Processing & Treatments**
- Images were resized and normalized using standard ImageNet preprocessing
- Data was split into training and validation sets with stratification
- Applied basic data augmentation (e.g., random flips and crops) to increase robustness
