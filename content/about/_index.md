Computer Science BSc., graduated from the [Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos](https://www.ufscar.br/) (UFSCar) in 2022, I've worked as a Data Scientist in various scenarios such as data analysis, data modeling, software development in data and machine leanring pipelines, designing and builing software tools and workflow automation/orchestration.

Although most of my effort is centered around the Artificial Intelligence area, I also enjoy studying and working on topics such as process automatization, software development, IoT, renewable energy, stock market, linguistics, astronomy and contributing to open-source projects.

I like to design and automate things.
